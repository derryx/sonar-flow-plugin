    DocTypes that are only locally publishable is usually not what you want.

   When you create a publishable doctype while your messaging solution (either Broker or UM) is down then Designer creates a DocType that is only publishable locally.
   This is usually not what you want and can create hard to debug problems when you deploy to an cluster of IntegrationServers in production environment.
