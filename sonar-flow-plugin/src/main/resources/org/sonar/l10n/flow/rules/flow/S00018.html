  Anonymous document definitions in service signatures
</p>

<p>
  In service signatures using anonymous document definitions is bad practice. Use doctype references instead.
  This increases code reuse because a mapping service from one structure to another is only coded once. And it becomes more obvious which document structures really exist in your application.
